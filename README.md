## 📚 About the project

This project was developed during a POO cours, by Ynov Campus. The goal was to learn basic Java concepts.

The application is a wallet manager that allows users to manage their finances. Users can add, remove, and view transactions, as well as see the history of their transactions. The application supports both income and expense transactions, providing a clear overview of the user's financial status.

The final project repository can be founded [here](https://github.com/Joshua31400/java-wallet.git)
